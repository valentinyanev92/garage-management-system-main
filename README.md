## 1. Project Overview

The **Garage Management System (GMS)** is a full-stack, multi-module platform for managing vehicles, repair orders, parts, and invoices within an auto-repair environment.

This project strictly follows all requirements of the **SoftUni Spring Advanced – Individual Project Assignment**, including:

- One **Main Spring Boot Application** (domain, business logic, UI)
- One **independent REST Microservice** (invoices, history, WhatsApp integration)
- Communication via **Feign Client**
- Asynchronous event processing via **Apache Kafka**
- **MongoDB** for the microservice
- **Redis caching**
- **Spring AI + Ollama local LLM** integration
- Fully **Dockerized infrastructure**

---

# 2. SoftUni Requirements Compliance

---

## 2.1 Technology Stack

### Backend
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.0
- Spring MVC / REST
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- Spring Validation
- Spring Scheduling
- Spring AI + Ollama
- Feign Client
- Redis Cache
- Kafka Producer / Consumer
- MongoDB (microservice)
- iText PDF generation

### Frontend
- Thymeleaf
- Bootstrap 5
- Custom CSS/JS

### DevOps
- Docker Compose
- Git + GitHub (public repo)

---

## 2.2 Project Architecture (Two Applications)

### **Main Application**
- Full domain model, services, repositories, controllers
- Thymeleaf UI
- Role-based dashboards: **USER**, **MECHANIC**, **ADMIN**
- Manages cars, parts, repair orders
- Triggers invoice generation via Feign
- Publishes repair-status events via Spring Events + Kafka

### **REST Microservice**
Runs independently under the context path: /api/v1

Handles:
- Invoice generation (PDF)
- Repair history lookups
- WhatsApp notifications (GreenAPI)
- MongoDB storage

---

## 2.3 Domain Entities

### Main Application (5 entities – MySQL)
- **User**
- **Car**
- **RepairOrder**
- **Part**
- **UsedPart**

**ID Strategy**
- All MySQL entities use **UUID** identifiers.
- Each entity includes its own **Repository** and **Service** layer.

---

### Microservice (3 entities – MongoDB)
- **InvoiceLog**
- **MessageLog**
- **RepairLog**

**ID Strategy**
- All MongoDB entities use **String-based** IDs generated by Spring Data MongoDB.
- UUID values are used only when referencing data coming from the main application (e.g., `repairId` in `InvoiceLog`).
- Each entity includes its own **Repository** and **Service** layer.

---

### Embedded Documents (Microservice Only)
- **UsedPartInfo** — embedded inside `InvoiceLog` for invoice generation

---

## 2.4 Web Pages (10+ required, 15+ implemented)

Dynamic pages include:
- Home
- Login / Register
- User dashboard
- Car pages (create, edit, delete, restore)
- Repair order pages (create, view status, complete)
- Mechanic dashboard
- Admin panel
- AI Mechanic Advisor – uses Spring AI + Ollama (local LLM) to analyze vehicle symptoms and provide suggested diagnostics, possible issues, and recommended steps.
- Invoice list page

Fully covers UI requirement.

---

## 2.5 REST Microservice Functionality

Context path: /api/v1


### **POST Endpoints**
| Endpoint                        | Description                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **POST /api/v1/invoices**       | Generate invoice (PDF) and store in MongoDB |
| **POST /api/v1/complete-order** | Send WhatsApp notification via GreenAPI     |

### **GET Endpoints**
| Endpoint                                     | Description                       |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **GET /api/v1/history**                      | Get all invoice/notification logs |
| **GET /api/v1/pdf/repair/{repairId}/latest** | Get logs for specific repair      |

→ Fully exceeds the requirement (2 modifying + 1 GET).  
→ Invoked by **Feign Client** from the main application.

---

## 2.6 Functionalities

### Main Application (12+ valid functionalities)
- Create / edit / delete / restore car
- Create repair order
- Accept repair order
- Add used parts

---

## 2.7 Security & Roles

### *Note:* 
The microservice intentionally does **not** use Spring Security, allowing the main application to communicate with it freely via Feign Client.


## User Roles & Permissions (RBAC Model)

The Garage Management System implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
with three roles: USER, MECHANIC, and ADMIN.

Below is a full permission matrix for all major system actions:

# 4. How to Run the Project

### 4.1 Clone both repositories
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/valentinyanev92/garage-management-system-main
  git clone https://github.com/valentinyanev92/garage-management-system-api
```
### 4.2 Start Docker infrastructure

### Note:
The microservice itself is not containerized; only the infrastructure (MySQL, Redis, Kafka, MongoDB, Ollama) runs via Docker.

From the main application directory:
```bash
  docker compose up -d
```

### This starts:
- MySQL
- Redis
- Kafka
- Zookeeper
- MongoDB (used by microservice)
- Ollama

### 4.3 Start Main Application
```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 4.4 Start Microservice
```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
```


## 4.5 Docker Services Breakdown

The project uses a full Docker-based infrastructure to support both applications.
All services are started automatically via `docker compose up -d`.

### Included Services

| Service       | Port  | Description                                            |
|---------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **MySQL**     | 3306  | Main application relational database                   |
| **MongoDB**   | 27017 | Document storage for the Invoice Microservice          |
| **Redis**     | 6379  | Caching layer used in the main application             |
| **Kafka**     | 9092  | Messaging platform for repair events and notifications |
| **Zookeeper** | 2181  | Required for Kafka coordination                        |
| **Ollama**    | 11434 | Local LLM engine used by Spring AI (Mechanic Advisor)  |

### Notes
- All containers are configured to work out-of-the-box with the main application and the microservice.
- Restarting Docker services does **not** lose data unless volumes are removed.
- Both applications can run independently as long as Docker services are active.
